"Borg","We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile. We are the Borg"

"Jean-Luc Picard","Part of having feelings is learning to integrate them into your life, Data, ...learning to live with them. No matter what the circumstances ... Sometimes it takes courage to try, Data. Courage can be an emotion too."
"Jean-Luc Picard","Someone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives. But I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment because they'll never come again. What we leave behind is not as important as how we've lived. After all, Number One, we're only mortal."
"Jean-Luc Picard","Reports of my assimilation are greatly exaggerated."
"Jean-Luc Picard","The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force of our lives. We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity."
"Jean-Luc Picard","The line must be drawn here! This far, no further!"
"Jean-Luc Picard","If there is one ideal that the Federation holds most dear, it is that all men, all races can be united."
"Jean-Luc Picard","Buried deep within you, beneath all the years of pain and anger, there is something that has never been nurtured: the potential to make yourself a better man. And that is what it is to be human. To make yourself more than you are. Oh, yes — I know you. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be."
"Jean-Luc Picard","Things are only impossible until they're not!"
"Jean-Luc Picard","The Prime Directive is not just a set of rules; it is a philosophy ... and a very correct one. History has proven again and again that whenever mankind interferes with a less developed civilization, no matter how well intentioned that interference may be, the results are invariably disastrous."
"Data Scientist","This is definately NOT a 6-hours home assignment"
"HR Recruiter","This assignment should take about 6 hours *wink*"
"Andrew (Ender) Wiggins","Remember - the enemy's gate is down"
"Andrew (Ender) Wiggins","I need you to be clever, Bean. I need you to think of solutions to problems we haven't seen yet. I want you to try things that no one has ever tried because they're absolutely stupid"
"Andrew (Ender) Wiggins","I don’t care if I pass your test, I don’t care if I follow your rules. If you can cheat, so can I. I won’t let you beat me unfairly - I’ll beat you unfairly first."
"Andrew (Ender) Wiggins","Sometimes lies were more dependable than the truth."
"Richard Feynman","I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there."
"Enrico Fermi","But where is everybody?"
"Jean-Luc Picard","Let's make sure history never forgets the name Enterprise."
"Jean-Luc Picard","There are times, sir, when men of good conscience cannot blindly follow orders. You acknowledge their sentience, but ignore their personal liberties and freedom. Order a man to turn his child over to the state? Not while I'm his captain."
"Jean-Luc Picard","I am Locutus of Borg. Resistance is futile."
"Jean-Luc Picard","The road from legitimate suspicion to rampant paranoia is very much shorter than we think."
"Jean-Luc Picard","No, I am not dead. Because I refuse to believe the afterlife is run by you. The universe is not so badly designed!"
"Jean-Luc Picard","Now, this will put the ship at risk. Quite frankly, we may not survive. But I want you to believe that I am doing this for a greater purpose, and that what is at stake here is more than any of you can possibly imagine. I know you have your doubts about me, about each other, about this ship. All I can say is that although we have only been together for a short time, I know that you are the finest crew in the fleet. And I would trust each of you with my life. So, I am asking you for a leap of faith — and to trust me."
